	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. It is a key concept in evaluating the efficiency of algorithms, as it helps us understand how quickly a solution can process data as the input grows.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to solve a problem as a function of the size of the input. For example, an algorithm that requires memory proportional to the input size would have a space complexity of O(n).
